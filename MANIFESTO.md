# Project Lens: A Protocol for Cognitive Sovereignty

## 01. Seeing Constructed Reality

A ceasefire “holds.” Then, overnight, it doesn’t — and two realities appear at once.

Consider a recent wave of Israeli strikes in Gaza that reportedly killed more than 30 people. In one account, the episode reads as rupture: the first reality is bodies and damage, and only then do competing claims arrive—Israel describes the strikes as a response to a breach, while Hamas counters that Israel violated the truce. The frame is human-scaled and observational: casualty figures attributed to Palestinian health officials, scenes of tents and homes, and an implicit premise that a ceasefire is “real” only insofar as civilians stop dying.

In another account, the same episode reads as enforcement. The initiating anchor is not “airstrikes,” but “truce violation.” The action is presented as a military response against “terror” infrastructure, while casualty numbers are bracketed as partisan and unverified. This isn’t just a difference in wording; it’s a different permission structure. It tells the reader what kind of world this is—and which forms of violence are legible, justified, and expected inside it.

What’s changed is scale and automation. Technology has industrialized this variance. Algorithms now optimize for comfort, not understanding. They reward cognitive laziness by endlessly reinforcing prior beliefs. AI systems, meanwhile, present themselves as neutral or omniscient—while quietly inheriting the blind spots, incentives, and historical weight of the data they are trained on.

## 02. The Lens Project

Lens is an experimental tool for **narrative reverse-engineering**. It does not claim to reveal the truth, but to make the construction of truth visible.

The current MVP is a GPT agent called **Lens** (see README for access). When given a news link or a topic, it deliberately searches across different information ecosystems and places multiple narratives side by side—not to determine which one is correct, but to expose how distinct “realities” are assembled from the same underlying facts.

## 03. Open Architecture

Lens is fully open-source, and its complete prompt architecture is published on GitHub. All my future modifications, forks, and derivative projects are intended to remain open as well.

The project maintains a strict principle of transparency. I strongly encourage anyone building on Lens to keep their **prompts, workflows, analytical logic, and system design** as open and inspectable as possible. Cognitive tools that cannot be examined quietly become instruments of authority. When the logic shaping perception is hidden, power accumulates in spaces users cannot see or question.

You are welcome to inspect, copy, adapt, or challenge the framework—to build your own version of Lens, or something that moves beyond it. I invite anyone interested to join the GitHub Discussions space and explore together:

- **Share Cases** — examples where narrative differences produced genuine cognitive friction.
- **Hack the Framework** — refine, extend, or overturn the PRISM+ analysis model.
- **Build New Lenses** — experiment with alternative configurations, such as:
  - **The Kaleidoscope**: introducing perspectives from the Global South, Europe, or East Asia etc. that are often absent from mainstream discourse.
  - **The Time Machine**: reporting current events through the language of past decades—or imagined futures.
  - **The Persona Lens**: generating interpretations from deliberately constrained viewpoints, such as an extreme skeptic or a market-first investor.

## 04. Self-Deconstruction

Absolute objectivity is an impossibility. Lens itself is also a lens. It is shaped by human choices, historical context, and unavoidable blind spots.

To acknowledge this limitation, my own Lens implementation (the GPT Agent) concludes every output with the following declaration:

I strongly recommend that derivative projects include a similar gesture of self-deconstruction. This is not intended as a legal disclaimer, but as an act of respect for the user’s cognitive autonomy. Those who choose to follow these recommendations help preserve the spirit of cognitive sovereignty in which this project was created.
