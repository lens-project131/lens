## 01. The Narrative Split

**Lens A (AP News):** *Putin rejects theory about Ukrainian role in pipeline blasts* (United States). ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0f05cb0bfd3f3e5f35968356404f5563))  
This is framed as a reaction story: Vladimir Putin responds to Western reporting and an ongoing European investigation. The piece keeps attribution open-ended while spotlighting Putin’s counter-accusation and the investigative “who/what is known” scaffolding. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0f05cb0bfd3f3e5f35968356404f5563))

**Lens B (TASS):** *Putin lambasts version on pipeline blast by Ukrainian activists* (Russia). ([tass.com](https://tass.com/russia/1588717))  
This is framed as a refutation of an “activists” narrative and a re-centering of state culpability: the blast is labeled as terrorism, and the “interested party” logic is used to point outward at the West, especially the U.S. The story is designed to feel like closure, not inquiry.

## 02. The Deep Dive

**Glitch Point 1: R Rhetoric**

Lens A keeps the temperature controlled. Its strongest language is quarantined inside quotation marks (“sheer nonsense”) and then balanced with procedural verbs like “dismissed,” “citing,” “reported,” and “confirmed,” turning the explosion into a moving file folder of claims, denials, and investigative steps. The narrative voice performs neutrality by constantly pinning agency to someone else’s mouth—Western outlets, prosecutors, Putin—so the reader experiences the story as an evidence-handling process rather than a verdict. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0f05cb0bfd3f3e5f35968356404f5563))

Lens B spikes the semantic field immediately: it calls the incident a “terrorist act,” positions the alternative explanation as “utter nonsense,” and uses “official Kiev” as a loaded shorthand that collapses Ukraine’s political legitimacy into a dismissive label. Even when it echoes similar factual structure (depth, power, specialists), the diction converts those details into moral classification and geopolitical accusation. That tonal choice shrinks the reader’s tolerance for ambiguity: if it’s “terrorism,” then the only remaining question is which enemy did it. ([tass.com](https://tass.com/russia/1588717))

**Glitch Point 2: I Inference / Causality**

Lens A treats causality like a contested zone. It foregrounds that the “Ukraine (or Ukrainians) may have been responsible” claim is coming from unnamed officials via major Western outlets, notes Ukraine’s denial, and adds a Germany-linked investigative detail (a searched boat) without letting that harden into conclusion. Only after that does it present Putin’s motive theory—cheap Russian gas vs pricier LNG—as his claim, not the article’s adjudication. The effect is a reader who can hold multiple hypotheses at once without feeling forced to pick a side. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0f05cb0bfd3f3e5f35968356404f5563))

Lens B runs a different inference engine: “who benefits?” becomes the master key, and the U.S. interest in replacing Russian gas with more expensive LNG is delivered as the rational endpoint of the story’s logic. It also tightens the actor model: amateurs/activists are ruled out because the operation “could only be made by specialists” backed by “the whole might of a state,” and the next beat (“Certainly”) invites the audience to treat Western culpability as the natural assumption. This is not an investigation narrative; it’s a causality narrative that wants to feel mathematically inevitable. ([tass.com](https://tass.com/russia/1588717))

## 03. Cognitive Delta

**Lens A Resident:**  
Reality feels like a procedural fog where the only honest posture is provisional belief. You’re encouraged to track who said what, what investigators “confirmed,” and what remains unproven, while treating every strong claim as a partisan move inside a larger geopolitical argument. Suspicion is allowed, but certainty is portrayed as premature. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0f05cb0bfd3f3e5f35968356404f5563))

**Lens B Resident:**  
Reality feels like an insult to your intelligence if you *don’t* see the “interest” pattern. The operation’s sophistication is presented as disqualifying non-state actors, so the narrative loop closes around state enemies by design. Ambiguity becomes a Western diversion tactic, and moral clarity is restored by naming the act “terrorism” and treating the U.S. motive as self-evident. ([tass.com](https://tass.com/russia/1588717))

## 04. Complete PRISM+ Comparison

The remaining PRISM+ dimensions function like structural beams that hold each story’s world together. Lens A’s support beams are procedural: it stacks institutional references (major outlets, prosecutors, ongoing national investigations) to simulate epistemic hygiene—less “truth,” more “chain-of-custody.” That architecture doesn’t tell you what to believe; it tells you what kind of believing is socially acceptable: cautious, source-aware, update-ready. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0f05cb0bfd3f3e5f35968356404f5563))

Lens B’s beams are declarative: it compresses the information ecosystem into a single authoritative speaker and a single governing heuristic (“look for those who are interested”). The silence is strategic—less competing testimony, fewer investigative caveats—because the point is to reduce interpretive degrees of freedom. The meta-message is that the alternative explanation is not merely wrong; it’s unserious. ([tass.com](https://tass.com/russia/1588717))

([tass.com](https://tass.com/russia/1588717)) | Managed ambiguity vs managed absence. |
| T Time | Anchors to “last week” reports and “January” search; references “last year” blasts.

([tass.com](https://tass.com/russia/1588717)) | Distributed credibility vs centralized credibility. |

([tass.com](https://tass.com/russia/1588717)) | Measurement-for-scene vs numbers-for-motive. |
